#Introduction

Steam Market Watcher is a little Python script that allows you to check at constant intervals over items you're looking for in the Steam Community Market. It lets you enter a price, and whenever one of your items meets the set price, it alerts you.

#Required

* [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/)

#How do I use this on windows?

Download the requirement above, install it.

Download the git repository (this project), go into the corresponding folder, press shift + right click -> Open command window here.

If this option isn't available for some reason, press Win+R, type `cmd`, then navigate to the folder. Example if you want to go to D:\Documents\steamMarketWatcher : http://i.imgur.com/9moUMbP.png

Then you can use the script as specified in the usage below.

#Usage:

    python ./marketWatcher --help | [-f path | item_name price] [-e]

        --help : displays this message.
        -f : reads the input into the file at path.
             File syntax : "object_name" price [newline]
             Your file can have as many lines as you'd like.
        -e : allows you to enter a price in euros.
        
Example file syntax:

    "avon of the crescent moon" 0.15
    lucentyr 4.20
    "Andalmere the Litigon" 0.99
    "StatTrakâ„¢ M4A1-S | Blood Tiger (Minimal Wear)" 200
    
Using upper or lower-case letters will not change anything.

Feel free to contact me about anything, you can use this script any way you like, and modify it.

#In case of any issue

Open an issue on github or shoot me an email at baruss.thomas@gmail.com

Hope this script serves you well!

#Possible issues

* Unicode characters that I don't handle. This will probably happen so tell me asap, should be a quick fix.

If the item isn't found, make the search yourself on https://steamcommunity.com/market/ and look if
you didn't mistype something or if the item's associated url is a bit funky. Then tell me if you can't
fix it yourself.
